# Deploy the Data Ingestion Environment & MLOps Pipelines
## What are the Prerequisites?
The list below is for _Windows_ environment
* The AWS CLI ([documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))
* Docker Desktop ([Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/))
* NPM and Node.js ([Documenttaion](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
* The AWS CDK: `npm install -g aws-cdk`
* Configure your programmatic access to AWS for the CLI (see instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_auth)).
## 1. Fork this Repository
## 2. Create an AWS Codestar Connection
Please refer to the AWS document [Create a connection to GitHub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-create-github.html)
## 3. Edit the Data Ingestion Configuration
In the [`bin/data-ingestion.ts` file](https://github.com/amanoxsolutions/mlops-realtime-data-ingestion/blob/main/bin/data-ingestion.ts#L35-L36) configure the
* repository name
* your AWS CodeStar connection name
```
new DataIngestionPipelineStack(app, 'DataIngestionPipelineStack', {
  [...]
  repoName: '<your GitHub user>/mlops-realtime-data-ingestion',
  codestarConnectionName: '<your CodeStar connection name>',
});
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must push the above changes to your repository fork before deploying the stack. The CodePipeline pipeline is a
> self-mutating pipeline. It updates itself with the latest changes from the repository. If you do not push the changes
> to the repository, the pipeline will fail as it will try to use the wrong CodeStar connection and download the
> code from the wrong repository.
## 4. CodeBuild Service Quotas
The fourth step of the project deployment pipeline creates 31 assets using CodeBuild.
In the AWS Quotas console, make sure that the CodeBuild service quotas are set to at least 30.
If not, request a quota increase. Otherwise, the deployment will fail with the following error:
```
Cannot have more than X builds in queue for the account.
```
An alternative is to click on the `Retry failed actions` button in the CodePipeline console to restart the build for
the failed assets.
## 5. Deploy the Environment
> [!TIP]
> If your AWS CLI is using a named profile instead of the default profile,  specify this profile when issuing
> AWS CLI & CDK commands using the `--profile <your profile name>` option or the AWS_PROFILE environment variable.

1. Start the Docker Desktop application.

2. Bootstrap the CDK (documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_bootstrap))
```
cdk bootstrap aws://<account number>/<aws region>
```

e.g.
```
cdk bootstrap aws://123456789012/eu-west-1
```


3. Install the Node.js modules defined in the package.json file
```
npm install
```

4. Verify the stack before deployment
```
cdk synth
```

5. Deploy the stack from the current Git branch
```
cdk deploy
```

To deploy the stack of a specific branch
```
cdk deploy --context branchToDeploy=feature/myFeatureBranch
```

This will deploy a self-mutating CI/CD pipeline. When you push code into your repository, the pipeline will be
automatically triggered.
It will
1. update itself if new stages have been added in the CI/CD pipeline.
2. package the code assets for the different stacks' deployment.
3. deploy the stacks in sequential orders using CloudFormation.
## 6. Deploy the MLOps Pipelines
#### Minimum Data Requirements
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that the __DeepAR model requires at least 300 observations to train a model__. As the ingestion pipeline
> aggregates the data per minute, it means that you need to ingest data for at least 5 hours before you can train
> your first model. If you deploy the __Model Build__ pipeline before you have enough observations, the SageMaker
> pipeline __TrainModel__ stage will fail with the following error: `ClientError: ClientError: Very low number of
> time observations (found 50 observations in 1 time series). DeepAR requires at least 300 observations., exit code: 2`

You can check the amount of observations stored in SageMaker Feature Store using Athena.
1. In the Athena console, select the `sagemaker_featurestore` database
2. Run the following query
```
SELECT count(*) FROM "sagemaker_featurestore"."mlops_********_agg_feature_group_********";
```
#### Deployment
Deploying the CDK project will deploy 3 CloudFormation stacks
* Common
* Data Ingestion
* SageMaker

The last one, through the use of Service Catalog will deploy a 4th CloudFormation stack for the MLOps SageMaker project.
As [described in the overall architecture](../README.md), this uses 3 git repositories, each to a corresponding
CodePipeline pipeline.

At first all those pipelines will fail; __this is normal__ since the code contained in those pipelines does not fit the
project and how could the __Model Deploy__ pipeline deploy a model and the __Model Monitor__ pipeline deploy the
resources to monitor a model, when none has been trained yet?

The code for each pipeline is provided to you in the `\resources\sagemaker` folder. You will have to clone each of the
CodeCommit repositories, replace the entire content with the one provided for each pipeline and commit the project code
for each repository.

The project provides you a SageMaker development environment with all the necessary credentials already granted, which
will simplify performing the operation. In the AWS Console,
1. Go to the __CodeCommit__ and copy the __HTTPS (GRC)__ link to clone each of the __Model Build__, __Model Deploy__ and __Model Monitor__ pipelines
2. Then go the the __SageMaker__ service
3. On the left panel, go to __Admin configurations > Domains__
4. You should see a SageMaker domain similar to `mlops-********-sagemaker-studio-domain`, click on it
5. A user `mlops-********-sagemaker-studio-user` has also been provision. Click on the `Launch` button and select `Studio`
6. Within your SageMaker Studio development environment, select `Code Editor` and create, run and open a code editor environment
7. Once in the environment, open a terminal window and execute the following command
```
pip install git-remote-codecommit
```
8. Still in the terminal configure your Git user using the commands:
```
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
9. Then follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/code-editor-use-clone-a-repository.html) to clone each of the model pipeline repositories using the __HTTPS (GRC)__  link you copied in step [1]
10. For each clone repository (build, deploy & monitor):
    1. In Code Editor open the repository folder
    2. Delete the entire content of each repository
    2. Upload the code from the `\resources\sagemaker` folder from your computer (pay attention to copy the right repository code)
    3. Commit & push all the changes for each repository

The __Model Build__ pipeline will start right away, provisioning and running the SageMaker pipeline to train a model.
But note that the __Model Deploy__ and __Model Monitor__ pipelines will also run and fail. At this stage this is normal
since no model has been trained yet. Once the __Model Build__ pipeline completes, a model is waiting for your
approval to be deployed. If you approve it the __Model Deploy__ pipeline will be triggered automatically.
See the [The MLOps Pipeline](./MLOPS.md) documentation for more details.
